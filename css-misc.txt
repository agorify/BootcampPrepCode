ID over rules Class.
Class over rules Type.
Type over rules * (universal)

The more specific a selector the more authority it has.

If multiple classes are applied to the same element, the Class listed furthest 
to the right over rules its neighbors to the left.

"Last Man" rule: When conflicts with equal authority arise, CSS will listen to the last style it was told to apply.
